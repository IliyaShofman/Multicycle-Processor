This repository contains my project for Computer Organization (ECE352), in which we implemented a multicycle CPU with some starter code. 
The 8-bit CPU can perform 10 different instructions, such as load/store, add/nand/ori, shift l/r.
A compiler converts the assembly code into machine instructions, which is then executed by runninig a ModelSim simulation.
